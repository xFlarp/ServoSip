This project, developed for ENGR 331, is an automated drink pourer system powered by an STM32 microcontroller (Cortex-M4). It uses a membrane keypad, ultrasonic sensor, LCD screen, pump, and GPIO-driven peripherals to automatically detect cup liquid levels and refill accordingly.

## Features
- Automatic refill when drink level is low
- Manual input of refill volume via keypad
- LCD feedback and status display
- LED indicators for cup level
- UART-based serial logging to PC
